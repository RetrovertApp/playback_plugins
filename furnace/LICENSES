--- Optional exception ---

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of {fmt}
give you permission to combine {fmt} with free software programs or
libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included
in the standard release of compiler libraries. You may copy and
distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU LGPL for {fmt}
and the licenses of the other code concerned, provided that you include
the source code of that other code when and as the GNU LGPL requires
distribution of source code.

Note that people who make modified versions of {fmt} are not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
